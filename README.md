# NeuroAdapt Learning

## About the Project

NeuroAdapt Learning is an AI-powered platform designed to adapt educational content for students with neurodiversities such as dyslexia and ADHD. The main idea of the project is to use AI to automatically transform learning materials according to the individual needs of the user, providing a personalized and more effective learning experience.

## Key Features

*   **Content Adaptation:** Automatic simplification and restructuring of text to improve readability.
*   **Text-to-Speech:** Conversion of text to speech with synchronized highlighting of read words for multimodal perception.
*   **Personalization:** Ability for the user to select their neuroprofile for fine-tuning adaptation algorithms.
*   **Progress Tracking:** A system for monitoring learning progress and analytics.
